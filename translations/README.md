After creating a new translation, create a new translation string inside "en-us.all.json", like the following:
```
    ...
    },
    {
        "id": "language_(languageCode)_name",
        "translation": "(your language name, in English)"
    },
    ...
```
where languageCode is the newly created ISO code (eg. ja-jp, pt-br).
