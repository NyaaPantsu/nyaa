# Nyaa replacement [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/ewhal/nyaa.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/ewhal/nyaa)

## Motivation
The aim of this project is to write a fully featured nyaa replacement in golang
that anyone will be able to deploy locally or remotely.

# Requirements
* Golang

# Installation
* Install [Golang](https://golang.org/doc/install)
* `go get github.com/ewhal/nyaa`
* `go build`
* Download DB and place it in your root folder named as "nyaa.db"
* `./nyaa`
* You can now access your local site over on [localhost:9999](http://localhost:9999)

## Usage

Type `./nyaa -h` for the list of options.

## Systemd

* Edit the unit file `os/nyaa.service` to your liking
* Copy the package's content so that your unit file can find them.
* Copy the unit file in `/usr/lib/systemd/system`
* `systemctl daemon-reload`
* `systemctl start nyaa`

The provided unit file uses options directly; if you prefer a config file, do the following:

* `./nyaa -print-defaults > /etc/nyaa.conf`
* Edit `nyaa.conf` to your liking
* Replace in the unit file the options by `-conf /etc/nyaa.conf`
