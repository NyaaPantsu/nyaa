/*
Syndication (feed) generator library for golang.

Installing

	go get github.com/gorilla/feeds

Feeds provides a simple, generic Feed interface with a generic Item object as well as RSS and Atom specific RssFeed and AtomFeed objects which allow access to all of each spec's defined elements.

Examples

Create a Feed and some Items in that feed using the generic interfaces:

	import (
		"time"
		. "github.com/gorilla/feeds
	)

	now = time.Now()

	feed := &Feed{
		Title:       "jmoiron.net blog",
		Link:        &Link{Href: "http://jmoiron.net/blog"},
		Description: "discussion about tech, footie, photos",
		Author:      &Author{Name: "Jason Moiron", Email: "jmoiron@jmoiron.net"},
		Created:     now,
		Copyright:   "This work is copyright Â© Benjamin Button",
	}

	feed.Items = []*Item{
		&Item{
			Title:       "Limiting Concurrency in Go",
			Link:        &Link{Href: "http://jmoiron.net/blog/limiting-concurrency-in-go/"},
			Description: "A discussion on controlled parallelism in golang",
			Author:      &Author{Name: "Jason Moiron", Email: "jmoiron@jmoiron.net"},
			Created:     now,
		},
		&Item{
			Title:       "Logic-less Template Redux",
			Link:        &Link{Href: "http://jmoiron.net/blog/logicless-template-redux/"},
			Description: "More thoughts on logicless templates",
			Created:     now,
		},
		&Item{
			Title:       "Idiomatic Code Reuse in Go",
			Link:        &Link{Href: "http://jmoiron.net/blog/idiomatic-code-reuse-in-go/"},
			Description: "How to use interfaces <em>effectively</em>",
			Created:     now,
		},
	}

From here, you can output Atom or RSS versions of this feed easily

	atom, err := feed.ToAtom()
	rss, err := feed.ToRss()

You can also get access to the underlying objects that feeds uses to export its XML

	atomFeed := &Atom{feed}.AtomFeed()
	rssFeed := &Rss{feed}.RssFeed()

From here, you can modify or add each syndication's specific fields before outputting

	atomFeed.Subtitle = "plays the blues"
	atom, err := ToXML(atomFeed)
	rssFeed.Generator = "gorilla/feeds v1.0 (github.com/gorilla/feeds)"
	rss, err := ToXML(rssFeed)
