        <h1>NOTICE: KEEP SEEDING YOU RETARD</h1>

        <h1>Official Nyaapocalypse FAQ</h1>

        <h2>Links for the replacement/mirror</h2>
        <a href="https://nyaa.pantsu.cat">Nyaa - nyaa.pantsu.cat</a>
        <a href="https://sukebei.pantsu.cat">Sukebei - sukebei.pantsu.cat</a>

        <h2>What happened?</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>- nyaa.se and associated domains (such nyaatorrents.info) went offline on May 01, 2017.</li>
            <li>- They were deactivated, so it's not a DDoS attack like usual.</li>
            <li>- Future prospects for nyaa are not looking good.</li>
            <li>- There is a recovery effort taking place.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Is everything Lost?</h2>
        <p>In short, No.</p>

        <h2>Are some things lost?</h2>
        <p>We have a database of the torrents on nyaa up to April 5. That means that everything past April 5 is gone.
            Sukebei, however is in worse shape. We only have sukebei databases up to 2016.</p>

        <h2>How are we recovering?</h2>
        <p>The aforementioned databases are being hosted at nyaa.pantsu.cat and sukebei.pantsu.cat.
            There is a search function, and (almost) full nyaa functionality should be coming soon.
            Unfortunately, due to the lack of a tracker and no plans to make one,
            seeder/leecher statistics will not be restored.</p>

        <h2>Are the torrents still working?</h2>
        <p>Even if the trackers are down, seeders are still connected to the decentralized DHT network.
            As long as the file is listed on the DHT network, business should carry on as usual.</p>

        <h2>How do I download the torrents?</h2>
        <p>Just use the <b>magnet link</b>. The magnet link will used by your BitTorrent client to look up the file on the
            DHT network and it should download just fine.</p>
        <p>If your magnet link starts with "magnet:magnet:", delete the first "magnet:". It should look like:
            magnet:?xt=urn:btih:[hash]&dn=[name]&tr=[tracker]</p>

        <h1>How can I help?</h1>
        <p>If you have website development expertise, you can join the #nyaapantsu IRC channel on irc.rizon.net. If you have any current databases, <b>UPLOAD THEM</b>.</p>

        <h1>nyaa.pantsu.cat and sukebei.pantsu.cat do not host any files.</h1>
