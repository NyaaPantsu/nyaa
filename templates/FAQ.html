        <h2>Links for the replacement/mirror</h2>

        <h2>What happened?</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>nyaa.se and associated domains (such as nyaatorrents.info) went offline on May 01, 2017.</li>
            <li>They were deactivated, so it's not a DDoS attack like usual.</li>
            <li>Future prospects for nyaa are not looking good. (It's dead)</li>
            <li>There is a recovery effort taking place.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Is everything lost?</h2>
        <p>In short, No.</p>

        <h2>Are some things lost?</h2>
        <p>We have a database of the torrents on nyaa up to <s>April 5</s> May 1. That means almost nothing is lost.</p>
        <p>Sukebei, however might be in worse shape. Currently we only have sukebei databases up to 2016,
           but a newer database might be available for use.</p>

        <h2>How are we recovering?</h2>
        <p>The aforementioned databases are being hosted at nyaa.pantsu.cat and sukebei.pantsu.cat.
            There is a search function, and (almost) full nyaa functionality should be coming soon.
            Seeder/leecher statistics are possible via scraping and might be restored sometime in the future,
            since other feature take priority right now.</p>

        <h2>Are the torrents still working?</h2>
        <p>Even if the trackers are down, seeders are still connected to the decentralized DHT network.
            As long as the file is listed on the DHT network, business should carry on as usual.</p>

        <h2>How do I download the torrents?</h2>
        <p>Just use the <b>magnet link</b>. The magnet link will be used by your BitTorrent client to look up the file on the
            DHT network and it should download just fine.</p>
        <p>The magnet link should look like this: <span style="font-family:monospace">
            magnet:?xt=urn:btih:[hash]&amp;dn=[name]&amp;tr=[tracker]&amp;tr=[...]</span></p>

        <h2>How can I help?</h2>
        <p>If you have website development expertise, you can join the #nyaapantsu IRC channel on irc.rizon.net.
           If you have any current databases, especially for sukebei, <b>UPLOAD THEM</b>.</p>

        <h2>Why is your shit written in Go?</h2>
        <p>It's the author's favorite programming language.</p>
